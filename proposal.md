# LearnMore - Interactive Course Creation Platform

## Project Overview

LearnMore is a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform designed to simplify the creation of online courses. This user-friendly platform enables educators, trainers, and companies to create multipage courses. Once a course is created, users can generate and print out sheets with QR codes linked to their course, making it exceptionally easy to share with learners in various settings. Additionally, LearnMore provides functionality for users to view learner progress.

## Core Features

### Course Creation and Management
- Intuitive course builder interface
- Support for multipage course structure
- Media integration (images, videos, documents)
- QR code generation for easy course sharing
- Progress tracking dashboard

### Enhanced Learning Experience
- **Interactive Navigation**: Allow learners to complete a course by navigating between course pages with a user-friendly interface that tracks progress and completion status
- **Assessment Tools**: Allow quiz questions (e.g., Multiple Choice, True/False, Short Answer) to be embedded throughout the course and tracked for performance analysis
- **Programming Education**: Implement functionality for teaching programming through gradable coding exercises for Python (using Pyodide) and JavaScript that can run directly in the browser

## Technical Implementation
